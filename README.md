# Implementation-of-Feature-Integration-Theory-using-Gabor-Filters
Implemented the two kinds of Visual Search tasks - Feature Search and Conjunction Search using orientation selective 2-D Gabor filters
Initially, an image was generated containing squares and triangles according to the type of visual search task.
Orientation selective 2-D Gabor Filters were then applied on the generated image to obtain the edges at different angles.
Number of contours of the shape was used to identify it as a Square or a Triangle and then the two types of visual search sasks compared.
